# Write a program to calculate the member fee for 4 members of a tennis club. For each of the 4 members,
# you must enter their name, their age and the number of years they are already member of the club.
# Members pay according to their age:
# •	Younger than 12: €20
# •	Aged between 12 and 18: €50
# •	Older than 18: €95
# If somebody is a member for at least 5 years, then he/she gets a discount of 10%.

# name = str(input('Give name: '))
# age = int(input('Give age: '))
# years = int(input('Years member: '))
# while years >= 5:
#     if age < 12:
#         cost += 20
#     elif age<=18:
#         cost += 50
#     else: cost += 95
#     cost=cost*0.10
# print(cost)
