# Exercise 4
# a)	Write a function generate_list that fills a list with a number of random
# integers between lower and upper limit. The number of generated numbers is given as a parameter as well
# as the lower and upper limit between which the generated numbers must fall. The generated list will be returned.
# For example:
# •	generate_list (5,1,3) returns a list of 5 numbers between 1 to 3 (inclusive)
# •	generate_list (10,5,7) returns a list of 10 numbers from 5 to 7 (inclusive)
#
# b)	Write a function filter that receives a list as a parameter and filters the same list so
# that only unique elements in the list are returned.
# For example: the list [1,2,3,3,4,5] is filtered into the following list of unique values [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
